# Values for a HA OpenBao cluster with Raft storage and TPM-based auto-unseal.
# This file is designed to be used with the official OpenBao Helm chart.
# It replaces the default container images and adds the necessary init and sidecar
# containers to enable TPM-based auto-unsealing using the bootstrap + sidecar pattern.

  # Replace the default OpenBao image with our custom-built image that includes
  # the entrypoint script for sourcing the unseal key from the sidecar.
